    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    
    <dl>
      <dt>How do I use this?</dt>
      <dd>Print the page! <strong>It'll only print the card part.</strong> Then click "Regenerate!" and print another page. Repeat for each person at your Adele Viewing Party.</dd>

      <dt>Is there a free space?</dt>
      <dd>&#x266B; Hello. It's free. &#x266B;</dd>

      <dt>Why these songs?</dt>
      <dd>The songs are taken from the <a href="http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/adele/2015/radio-city-music-hall-new-york-ny-23f56453.html" target="_blank">setlist.fm</a> listing for this concert. Hopefully they're right!</dd>

      <dt>Why are there duplicate songs?</dt>
      <dd>Adele only played 13 songs. Bingo requires 25 spaces. Therefor, Hello is the free space and then each other song she played appears twice at random.</dd>

      <dt>Why does this exist?</dt>
      <dd>Last year, my girlfriend printed out Oscar Awards Bingo cards in an effort to get me to watch the show with her. After spending hours furiously hunting for Ben Affleck in the crowd, I realized that Bingo can make anything fun. She wants to watch the Adele Live in NYC concert, so I figured this was another good opportunity for Bingo!</dd>
      
      <dt>But like really, why?</dt>
      <dd>I was expecting the Patriots to blow out the Texans last night so I wanted a fun little thing to do. This was bootstrapped, totally excessively, by <a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites" target="_blank">Foundation For Sites</a> because I wanted to play around with the <a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation-cli" target="_blank">foundation-cli</a> and build process.</dd>

      <dt>I snooped at your source code and you xx'ed when you should have yy'ed. Why why?</dt>
      <dd>You're probably right. I threw this together as quickly as possible with very little thought to quality or efficiency. I would, however, love to hear your suggested improvements so please feel free to submit an issue (or better yet, a pull request!) <a href="https://github.com/ryangiglio/adele-bingo" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>! Or you can Tweet me <a href="http://twitter.com/ryangiglio" target="_blank">@ryangiglio</a>.</dd>
